    <h2>What is sap</h2>
    
    <p>
    SIM Access Profile (SAP) allows a Bluetooth enabled device to access data contained in the SIM card of another Bluetooth enabled device.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You probably don't need this function, so you can disable it.
    </p>

    {% highlight "bash" %}
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d/
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d/01-disable-sap-plugin.conf

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --noplugin=sap

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth.service

    {% endhighlight %}
    
    <p>
    Note: The double usage of ExecStart= in the SystemD bluetooth.service.d override file is important! 
    The first line with empty assignment, "ExecStart=", clears out the value of ExecStart 
    so we can override it later rather than append to it. 
    Some SystemD settings such as ExecStart behave as an appended list when specifying them multiple times.
    Many options that you want to override will apply to this use case when we use foo.service.d/*.conf files.
    So it's important to notice that an extra Foo= setting may be necessary to override a value rather than append to a list.
